# Application memory

The durable record of how Meridian got built: what exists, what was decided and
why, where the code deviates from `docs/SPEC.md`, and what is still unanswered.

**Update this at the end of every phase.** It is written for whoever picks the
work up next — including a future session with no memory of this one.

## Current state

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Phase | 2 complete (Foundations, Auth & Couple, Trips) |
| Next | Phase 3 — Itinerary (spec Module 5) |
| Branch | `claude/ldr-travel-app-foundation-56w6xg` |
| Supabase project | **not yet provisioned** — see Open questions |
| Deployed | no |

### What runs today

Sign in with Google → create or join a couple by code → fill in a profile →
create trips, set their dates at whatever precision you actually know, set each
partner's own arrival and departure, and see how many nights you overlap. The
trip detail page has its full tab bar; the tabs themselves land in later phases.
Typecheck, lint, 79 unit tests and a production build pass.

### What is stubbed

- `src/types/database.ts` is hand-maintained against the migrations. Once a
  project exists, replace it with `supabase gen types typescript` output.
- Every route under `AppShell` renders `Placeholder` until its phase lands.
- `coarseTimezoneFromLongitude` in `lib/geocode.ts` is a placeholder for the
  `tz-lookup` package, which arrives with Destinations (Module 4) — that is the
  first module that genuinely needs coordinate→zone precision.

## Decisions

Decisions that are not simply "what the spec said". Each records the reasoning,
because the reasoning is what a future change needs to argue with.

### D1 — One couple per user, enforced by a unique index

The spec caps a couple at two members. It does not explicitly forbid a user from
belonging to two couples, but `partner_id()` returns `limit 1` and every policy
assumes a single couple. A `unique index on couple_members (user_id)` makes that
assumption true rather than hoped-for. Consequence: joining requires leaving
first, which the spec's "both users created a couple" edge case already expects.

### D2 — Invite codes are minted in Postgres, not the browser

Spec 1.3 shows the alphabet client-side. Uniqueness can only be enforced where
the uniqueness constraint lives, so `generate_invite_code()` loops until it finds
a free code inside the database. The client-side generator survives in `logic.ts`
for previews and tests only.

### D3 — `join_couple` distinguishes expired from invalid

The spec's RPC folds both into `INVALID_CODE`. Spec 1.7 separately requires
"expired code → clear message, offer regenerate", which needs the two cases
distinguished. The RPC raises `EXPIRED_CODE` and `INVALID_CODE` separately, and
`lib/errors.ts` maps each to its own copy.

### D4 — `onboarded_at` on profiles

Not in the spec's schema. Without it, "has this person finished setup?" has to be
inferred from whether fields are filled — which re-prompts anyone who genuinely
lives on UTC, or who deliberately left a field blank. An explicit stamp makes the
gate honest and is one column.

### D5 — `my_couple_id()` helper

The spec defines `is_couple_member()` and `partner_id()`. Nearly every insert also
needs "which couple am I in?", and doing that as a client round trip on every
mutation is wasteful. Added as a third SECURITY DEFINER helper.

### D6 — Vitest 3, not 2

Vitest 2 bundles its own Vite 5, which type-conflicts with the Vite 6 the app
builds on. Vitest 3 shares the installed Vite.

### D7 — `RestfulEmpty` takes no action prop

Spec 5.3 calls the distinction between the two empty states "the single most
important behavioural rule" in the itinerary module. Making it impossible to pass
a call to action to `RestfulEmpty` turns a rule that must be remembered into one
the compiler enforces.

### D8 — Invite expiry is described in hours under a day

"Expires today" is wrong for a code that dies at 08:00 tomorrow. Under 24 hours
the copy counts hours.

### D9 — Day scaffolding is one RPC, not N client inserts

`sync_trip_days()` does the whole set difference in a single transaction.
Generating days client-side means one round trip per day (a 31-day trip is 31
inserts) and races when both partners edit dates at the same moment. The client
still computes the diff locally via `diffTripDays` — but only to decide whether
to *prompt*, never to perform the write.

### D10 — Purity: date logic takes `today`, not a timezone

`groupTrips`, `countdownDays` and `isStalePlanning` take the viewer's calendar
date rather than their IANA zone. Passing a zone made them read the clock, which
is untestable and hides whose midnight is being used. Callers do
`todayIn(tzSelf)` — which also makes the "in whose timezone?" question (spec 2.6)
visible at each call site.

### D11 — `unwrap*` infers the envelope, not the row

A Supabase response is a union of a success and a failure shape. A plain `<T>`
inferred against it picks up `null` from the failure branch and collapses every
row type to `never` — silently, because property access on `never` is legal. The
helpers now infer the whole envelope and extract the payload with a distributive
conditional type. This bug would otherwise have quietly disabled type checking
on every query in the app.

### D12 — Both partners become travelers on trip creation

Spec 3.2 says per-traveler dates default to the trip's start and end. Rows have
to exist for that to be editable, so `createTrip` seeds a `trip_travelers` row
for each member with null dates, and the UI falls back to the trip's own dates
while they stay null. That keeps "inherited" visually distinct from "chosen".

## Deviations from the spec

| Spec | Code | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.3 `join_couple` raises `INVALID_CODE` for expiry | Raises `EXPIRED_CODE` | D3 — spec 1.7 needs the cases distinguished |
| 1.1 `profiles` columns | Adds `onboarded_at` | D4 |
| 0.4 `couple_members` | Adds a unique index on `user_id` | D1 |
| 0.2 module layout | `providers/` holds Auth/Couple/Theme as specified; `components/common/` also holds `ErrorBoundary` | A render crash on a phone in an airport must not be a blank page |
| 3.1 `trip_days` | Adds `created_at` / `updated_at` | Part 0.3 requires them on every table; the module's own schema block omitted them |
| 3.1 `trip_travelers` | Same | Same |
| 3.3 day regeneration | Set difference runs in `sync_trip_days()` | D9 |
| 3.2 shortening prompt | Prompts on days carrying a note or a non-open day type | Itinerary items don't exist until Phase 3; the check extends to them then |

Nothing else diverges. Where the spec gave SQL verbatim, the migration uses it
verbatim.

## Open questions

Ordered by how much they block.

1. **Supabase project.** None exists yet — the org has only an unrelated
   `ascent-track`. Someone needs to create one (region chosen deliberately: put
   it near whichever partner reads more, latency-wise), then:
   - apply `supabase/migrations/0001_foundation.sql`
   - enable the Google provider and set the OAuth redirect to the deployed origin
   - set the `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` repository secrets for the
     keep-alive workflow
   - regenerate `src/types/database.ts`
   Until then the RLS verification in Phase 0 cannot run, and it is the one thing
   the spec says to confirm before proceeding.
2. **Hosting.** Vercel or Cloudflare Pages, both free. Needs an SPA rewrite rule
   so deep links like `/trips/:id/plan` resolve.
3. **`requires_country` on `document_types`** (spec 8.1) is declared but no
   feature reads it. Resolve when Documents lands.
4. **Open-ended trips have a 30-day horizon** (spec 3.6). Nothing rolls it
   forward yet — a trip open-ended for two months will show a stale grid. The
   cheapest fix is to re-run `sync_trip_days()` on trip open; decide when the
   itinerary makes the cost visible.
5. **Overlap warnings** are computed (`overlappingTrips`) but not yet surfaced.
   The natural home is the trip list, once there are enough trips for it to
   matter.
6. **Health module scope.** The spec says design it together, last. Left alone.
